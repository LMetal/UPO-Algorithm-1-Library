UPO-Algorithm-1-Library is a set of algorithms, data structures, test and apps for ADT (Abstract Data Type) in C.

This includes ADT for:
- Sorting (Mergesort, Insertionsort, Quicksort)
- BST (a variety of algorithms)
- Stack

Also includes various apps, under the apps folder, to further test and understand the algorithms and principles. This include:
- playlist sorting
- sort algorithms comparaison

Tests for every algorithm can be found in the test folder.

Everything was tested with valgrind, therefore memory-leaks safe.
No warning occours when compiling with gcc and -Wall -Wextra -Wconversion flags.
